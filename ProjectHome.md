Babelium will allow you to:
  * Upload and label videos to use them as learning material
  * Add subtitles to those videos in a collaborative way
  * Define the characters that appear in a video to do dubbing exercises
  * Record yourself (using your webcam and/or microphone) while you do different kinds of exercises: dubbing of a role, short q&a interviews, topic-based free speech, reading a text aloud
  * Be assessed by other users (native speakers of the language you are practicing)
  * Assess users that are practicing your native language

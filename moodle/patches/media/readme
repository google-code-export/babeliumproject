This placeholder video is a temporary solution while we find a suitable way to determine whether a video exists in the red5 server or not.
Meanwhile this video should be present in red5 and be linked while the merge files are created.

RED5_HOME/webapps/oflaDemo/streams/placeholder_merge.flv

placeholder_merge.svg has the vectorial sources to create the image that is looped in the placeholder video. 
But in order to create the video you need to export the vectorial image to a bitmap, such as png. You can do this opening the svg with inkScape.

Here's the commandline to create a 20second video using the exported image
ffmpeg -y -loop 1 -f image2 -i placeholder_merge.png -ar 22050 -f s16le -i /dev/zero -r 25 -t 25 -s 426x240 -g 25 -qmin 3 -b:v 512k placeholder_merge.flv
